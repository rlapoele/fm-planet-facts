# Frontend Mentor "Planets fact site" challenge solution

Hey Hi 🙋🏻‍♂️ !

I'm **Renaud** and this is my solution to the [Frontend "**Planets fact site**" challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges help developers improve their programming skills by building realistic projects; the "Quiz App" project is one of those.

The original requirements for this app (beside trying to adhere to the given visual design) were :

_Your users should be able to:_

- _View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs_
- _View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size_
- _See hover states for all interactive elements on the page_


I've implemented this using [#vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [#solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [#tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Hope you like it!
